# Mediator
The mediator pattern is a design pattern dedicated to remove the exponential dependency growth of objects. Whenever two or more objects need to interact, they'll do it through the mediator instead of directly.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation in this repository uses the example from [Refactoring Guru](http://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method).
