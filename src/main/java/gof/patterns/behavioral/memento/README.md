# Memento
Memento is a pattern used to allow the user to undo previously actions executed by the user and its effects. It can be seen in text editors or any kind of undoable operation. It separates the concerns of restoring the object, the old state and the concrete object.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation in this repository uses the example from [Refactoring Guru](http://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method).
