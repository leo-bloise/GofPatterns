# Command
The Command pattern is a design pattern that encapsulates a request into an object. It separates the client object from the execution of command. For example, if your command is encapsulated inside a method in the caller class, you can extract it to a separated object. Besides, you can keep track of executed commands and enable undo and redo operations easily.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation in this repository does not uses the example from [Refactoring Guru](http://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method).
