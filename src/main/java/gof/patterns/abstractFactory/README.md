# AbstractFactory
This design pattern allow us to create, basically, a factory of factories. It would be responsible for creating the object that holds the factory method we need.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation in this repository uses the example from [Refactoring Guru](http://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method) and all factory methods have comments to highlight it.
