# Prototype
The Prototype design pattern is dedicated to the process of cloning objects. Instead of manually clone them, copying property per property or gathering all the information again, we delegate the process of clone to the actual object. This is the prototype design pattern.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation in this repository uses the example from [Refactoring Guru](http://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method).
