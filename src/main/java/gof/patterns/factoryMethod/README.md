# Factory Method
Factory method is a design pattern dedicated to creating objects. Usually, we'd use this pattern when we need to create different objects to execute different stuff, but they're all related to the same functionality.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation in this repository uses the example from [Refactoring Guru](http://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method) and all factory methods have comments to highlight it.
