# Builder
The builder design pattern allows us to separate the whole process of creation of an object into a separated routine. It helps to reduce complexity and decouple responsibility from objects that needs to build another object.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation in this repository uses the example from [Refactoring Guru](http://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method).
