# Facade
The facade design pattern allows us to provide a general interface for a complex operation involving a broad set of objects in the application. Therefore, any other object needing to perform an operation provided by the facade has te complexity hidden from the implementation.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation in this repository does not use the example from [Refactoring Guru](http://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method).
