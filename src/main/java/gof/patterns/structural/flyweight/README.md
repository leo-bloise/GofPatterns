# Flyweight
The Flyweight pattern is a design pattern that helps reduce the memory footprint of an application. It is particularly useful in scenarios where many objects share the same or very similar properties. The core idea of this pattern is to extract the shared, repeated data into a separate object. This shared object is immutable, while the unique, changeable data remains within the individual objects.
