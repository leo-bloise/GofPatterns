# Composite
Composite is a design pattern that allows us to treat hierarchical objects and simple objects as the same. It's accomplished by declaring a common interface with all common operations applied to the whole family of objects.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation in this repository does not use the example from [Refactoring Guru](http://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method).
